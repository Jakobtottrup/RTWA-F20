Now your game will be extended to multiple players, and the players will be able to interact with few simple items in each room. 
To complete this task you need to do the following:
	When a player enters the game she decides a username; a simple system to log in and out will be necessary here, with many players, each of them will need a specific and unique username.
	Players do not have to interact directly with each other in this version of the game. However, every player should be able to pick-up or drop an item in his/her room. Items can be moved (picked up, then dropped in a different room).  Perhaps you can give your characters the capability to create and destroy an item. 
	You should use web-sockets to implement your multiplayer chat.
	The state of the items in the room will be stored (persistency) on the node.js server, using a NoSQL DB. Also the passwords and usernames need to be stored on the NoSQL DB. 
	When a player leaves the game, its state remains the same (on the server), so the next time the same player logs in, she will continue as she never left.
