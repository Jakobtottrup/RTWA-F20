You will start with a single-player, chat-like client-server system, using node.js and javascript. 
The goal of task is mainly to use javascript to create a chat-like game. Libraries like jQuery should be used.

To complete this task you need to do the following:

	The HTML page containing the game should be loaded from a node.js server. 
	Some settings and data in the game (such as the initial state of the game or initial player salutation) should be loaded via AJAX from a JSON file on the server.
	Implement a highscore table in the client, by storing data in local storage. 
	You will add 3 rooms and provide basic navigation commands to the player, in the client. I.e. the player should start in the “main” room each time the game is loaded, and be able to move from room to room via simple text-based commands. 

It is not important at this stage that the player’s avatar is able to interact with items or NPCs that might exist in the rooms.
